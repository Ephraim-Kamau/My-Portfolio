                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3>I love creating software solutions and systems to solve complex problems which in turn make life easier. Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by machines and how they work.
                 As time passed on, my interest  piqued and I decided to pursue this passion in campus. <br><br> While on campus,  I learnt how to code in various languages such as C and C++. After clearing campus, 
                 I decided to join Moringa School to advance my knowledge and skills in programming. For the 5 months I was in Moringa School, I spent over 1000 hours writing code and creating real applications. <br><br>

                 I learned JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and specialized in Full Stack Web Development. I learned how to work together with others in teams and we came up with an application called Moringa Pitch.
                  The application allowed Moringa School students to view the projects that had been created by previous students. The students could also pitch their own projects and have them rated by other students.<br><br>
